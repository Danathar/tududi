# Agent task traceability

How to start from an agent's change in `Danathar/tududi` and find the task that
produced it, and how this directory records that going forward. Rules for agents
are in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md); how several agents share the repository is
in [`multi-agent.md`](../multi-agent.md).

Every PR and issue goes to this fork, never to `chrisvel/tududi`: every `gh`
command here passes `--repo Danathar/tududi`. See `AGENTS.md`, section "This
repository is a fork. All work happens here."

## What a ledger is

One file per day or working session, named `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (add `-2`, `-3` for a
second session on the same day). It lists, for each task:

| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| issue | the GitHub issue the work answers, `#N` |
| branch | the branch the work was done on |
| PR | the pull request number once one exists; `-` before that. Never guess one |
| outcome | `open`, `merged`, `closed unmerged`, `abandoned`, with the reason if not `merged` |
| agent | who did it: a Hive agent (`agent=<name>` from the signature line), the Codex connector, or a local session (tool and model) |
| Hive run | the link to the Hive run if Hive did the work, or `none` |

A ledger is a record of what was planned and what happened on that date. Add
rows and fill in PR and outcome as they become known. Do not rewrite history in
it; if a later fact contradicts a row, add a dated note under the table.

## Following one change end to end

```text
file/line --git blame--> commit --gh api repos/Danathar/tududi/commits/<sha>/pulls--> PR
PR --Closes #N--> issue (the task statement)
PR --signature line / author--> agent
issue/branch/PR --this directory--> the ledger row
```

The marks a change carries, and where to read them:

- **Closing reference.** A pull request body begins with `Closes #N`:

  ```bash
  gh pr view <N> --repo Danathar/tududi --json closingIssuesReferences \
    --jq '[.closingIssuesReferences[].number]'
  ```

- **Hive signature.** Hive PRs end with a line like `— hive: agent=<name> ...`
  and are opened by `app/danathar-atomic-hive`:

  ```bash
  gh pr view <N> --repo Danathar/tududi --json author,body \
    --jq '.author.login, (.body | split("\n") | map(select(startswith("— hive: "))))'
  ```

  A PR the owner opened from a local session carries the owner's login and may
  carry no signature; do not read "unsigned" as "human-written".
- **Branch name.** The ACMM effort used `acmm/<slug>`; Hive names
  its own branches. A branch survives its deletion in the PR record:

  ```bash
  gh pr list --repo Danathar/tududi --state all --head <branch> --json number,state,mergedAt
  ```

- **Merge commits.** `git log origin/main --first-parent --merges --grep='<branch>'`.
- **Audit.** [`agent-audit.yml`](../../.github/workflows/agent-audit.yml) reports
  weekly which agent PRs lack a closing reference, a signature or a human merger.

None of these is enforced for every change. A mark can be missing; the ledger is
how the gap is closed by hand.
